With the rapid technological development of robust and intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), typically referred to as drones, much opportunities have emerged to provide Drone-as-a-Service (DraaS) to help industries such as agriculture, energy and utilities, GIS, package delivery, cinematography, industrial inspection and many more. The capability of drones to lift payload, acquire data with camera and sensors mounted on it make drones as a useful tool for various commercial applications. However, there exist great challenges for executing autonomous missions, operations, management, ensuring safety and secure communications. In this research paper, we review the latest research in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain applied for DraaS. The data from GPS transmitters in cars can be used to create a map of current traffic and predict future traffic patterns for traffic control and congestion analysis. However, the limited number of cars equipped with GPS transmitters compared to the total number of cars on the road creates difficulties in reconstructing the traffic map, as the information obtained is rare and incomplete, making it challenging to estimate travel velocities from sparse data.
