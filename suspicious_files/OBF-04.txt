Nowadays, machine learning is prominent in most research fields. Neural Networks (NNs) are considered to be the most efficient and popular architecture nowadays. Among NNs, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most popular algorithms for image processing and image recognition. The article presents a Convolution Neural Network-based Real-Time Image Processing Framework (CNN-RTIPF) that can classify every move made in Ice Hockey. By using CNN-RTIPF, monitoring individual player movements becomes less challenging.They are therefore widely used in the industry, for instance for facial recognition software. However, they are targeted by several reverse-engineering attacks on embedded systems. These attacks can potentially find the architecture and parameters of the trained neural networks, which might be considered Intellectual Property (IP). The reliability of the proposed CNN-RTIPF has been validated through optimization parameters. In the future, the algorithm for movement identification will be further improved, and the system will be trained for various other everyday activities using human-centered artificial intelligence-based Web 4.0 technology.This paper introduces a method to protect a CNN's parameters against one of these attacks (Tramer et al., 2016). For this, the victim model's first step consists in adding noise to the input image so as to prevent the attacker from correctly reverse-engineering the weights
