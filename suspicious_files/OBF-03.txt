In the field of automatic inspection and factory quality inspection, it is often necessary to analyze the readings of many different types of meters to understand the working status of the factory. Therefore, it is particularly important to get an accurate reading. To solve this problem, an automatic meter reading system based on core technologies such as image recognition, deep learning, internet of things and intelligent machine car was designed. The paper presents a comparison between active learning, machine teaching, and combined approaches in an interactive online framework. While active learning treats the human as a passive, always correct participant, machine teaching provides a more proactive role for the human. However, machine teaching assumes that the human is constantly monitoring the learning process. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined approach. We adopted YOLOV3, SIFT, FLANN, Hough transform and other efficient algorithms to achieve the function of reading meter. Our system is competent for the reading of digital meter as well as pointer meter. Experiments show that our system has a good effect..The chapter focuses on the importance of human interpretation in the context of automated scientific discovery, where the theories produced by machines need to be understood by humans. It provides an introduction to some of the most influential ideas and concepts in machine learning research to give readers a basic understanding of the field. Section 2 discusses the general ideas on how learning problems can be framed.
